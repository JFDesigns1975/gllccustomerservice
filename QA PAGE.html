        <p>Daily watering for 20 to 30 minutes in each zone during early morning
            is highly recommended. Newly seeded areas must be watered daily for germination to occur.</p>

            After a liquid weed & feed application, we recommended
            waiting at least 2 hours until the product has time to dry.
            As far as granular applications are concerned, use the same
            guidelines as if you were treating the lawn yourself.

            Treatments that are applied 1 time for specific reasons, such as grub control or fungicide
            are guaranteed for 30 days. Treatments that are part of any program with 4 or more scheduled
            applications are backed by free service calls. Treatments in the program are guaranteed
            up to 21 days and can be reapplied at no cost to the customer within that 21 day window.
            If a service call is requested after day 21, the next chargeable application will be
            scheduled and completed as soon as possible.

            There are many factors involved when establishing and maintaining a thick and healthy
            lawn. Weather, types of treatments, hydration, and most importantly communication.
            Things like disease and insects can have an extreme negative impact on your lawn.
            Furthermore, the amount of time that lasting damage can occur is a matter of days or
            weeks. Letting us know that there is turf loss as soon as you see an issue an save
            time, effort, and money. Once turf has died fertilization will have no effect and
            replanting and repairing will be the only option. Newly seeded areas must be watered
            daily to establish new turf, which can take up to 4 weeks to occur. When seeding
            yourself, please contact our office and mark the areas of new seed. This will help
            avoid unwanted products from being applied to these areas, which could have a
            negative affect on the germination of the seed. Additional treatments such as lime,
            insecticide, or fungicide may be required in order to maintain the beauty of your lawn.
            Other larger plants can also factor into the health of your grass. In some cases
            large mature trees can inhibit the growth of grass since they compete for the very
            fertilizer we apply to your yard.

            Great Lakes Landcare tailors our programs for each individual situation to best improve
            the look and health of your lawn. Without proper communication and maintenance from our
            customers the services we provide may not be enough to give you the thick dream lawn you
            are looking to establish.
